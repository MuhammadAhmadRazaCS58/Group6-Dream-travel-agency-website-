Welcome to the official repository for the **Dream Travel Agency** website. This project serves as the final capstone for our AICTL course, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of modern front-end design principles using foundational web technologies.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Dream Travel Agency** web platform is a multi-page, fully responsive site designed to provide a seamless user experience for travelers. The goal was to create a visually appealing interface that balances aesthetic travel imagery with functional navigation and clear calls to action.

### **Key Features**

* **Curated Gallery:** A dedicated space showcasing global destinations with a focus on visual storytelling.
* **Full Responsiveness:** Optimized for viewing across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

To ensure a lightweight and fast-loading experience, we utilized:

* **HTML5:** Structured for semantic clarity and SEO optimization.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling using Flexbox and Grid layouts for a modern, responsive feel (no external frameworks used).

## 📂 Architecture & File Structure

The project is organized with modularity in mind, using specific stylesheets for individual pages to ensure clean code maintenance:

```text
Dream-Travel-Agency
│── index.html          (Main Landing Page)
│── about us.html       (Brand Story)
│── contact us.html     (Lead Generation)
│── gallery.html        (Visual Portfolio)
│── style.css           (Global Variables & Home Styles)
│── [page] style.css    (Specific Page Modules)

```


## 🎯 Learning Objectives & Challenges

As a student-led project, this served as a practical application of classroom theories. We focused on:

1. **UI/UX Design:** Learning how to lead a user's eye toward "Book Now" buttons.
