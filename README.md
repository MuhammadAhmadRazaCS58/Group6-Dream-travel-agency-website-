## 🛠️ Technical Stack

To ensure a lightweight and fast-loading experience, we utilized:

* **HTML5:** Structured for semantic clarity and SEO optimization.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling using Flexbox and Grid layouts for a modern, responsive feel (no external frameworks used).

## 📂 Architecture & File Structure

The project is organized with modularity in mind, using specific stylesheets for individual pages to ensure clean code maintenance:

```text

│── index.html          (Main Landing Page)
│── about us.html       (Brand Story)
│── contact us.html     (Lead Generation)
│── blog page.html      (Content Hub)
│── gallery.html        (Visual Portfolio)
│── style.css           (Global Variables & Home Styles)
│── [page] style.css    (Specific Page Modules)

```


## 🎯 Learning Objectives & Challenges

As a student-led project, this served as a practical application of classroom theories. We focused on:

1. **UI/UX Design:** Learning how to lead a user's eye toward "Book Now" buttons.
